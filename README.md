4th Semester Game Project: Hearthstone Replica.
This is a turn-based card game between two opponents. 
Players use their limited mana crystals to play abilities or summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal of destroying the opponent's hero. 
This involved implementation using Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and GUI swing features.
